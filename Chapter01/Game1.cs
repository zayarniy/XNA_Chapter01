/*
Tasks:
As simple as it is, here are a couple of enhancements you could make to SquareChase:
1) Vary the size of the square, making it smaller every few times the player catches
one, until you reach a size of 10 pixels.
2) Start off with a higher setting for TimePerSquare and decrease it a little each time
the player catches a square. (Hint: You'll need to remove the const declaration in
front of TimePerSquare if you wish to change it at runtime).
